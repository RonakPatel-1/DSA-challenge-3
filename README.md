In this we will be compressing multiple format of files and then compress it.

Pre steps - Let's run this code into Windows Machine
Step 1: Run the python program compress_multi_format_files.py in python 3.6 or greater version

Step 2: It will ask the folder path which we need to enter manaully, just enter the full folder path without any quotations

step 3 : Let us have some multiple format of files under that folder which we can compress, so this is a step as pre-requiste to arrange these multi format files like in below eg.

step 6 : Now go to the folder where that .py program was saved and check that directory. In my case i have saved that programm under F:\ineuron_poc so i will go there and see the below output the files are zipped
